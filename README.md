# Pi-puck ROS Packages

## Introduction

This repository contains all the ROS driver packages for support for the Pi-puck robotics platform.

### Pi-puck

The Pi-puck is a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) extension board for the [e-puck](http://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php?title=E-Puck) and [e-puck2](http://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php?title=e-puck2) robot platforms, designed and built as a collaboration between the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/robot-lab/) and [GCtronic](http://www.gctronic.com).
